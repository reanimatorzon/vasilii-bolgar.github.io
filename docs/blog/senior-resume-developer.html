      <section>
        <p>The very first step of an interview isn’t a call with a recruiter - it’s your resume. When you’re a Senior+
          engineer entering the job market, you’re much more confident than before. You have solid skills and plenty of
          experience to show.</p>
        <p>But here’s the trick: a good resume shouldn’t be long or hard to read. If you try to include everything you
          know, the document will simply explode in size.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The shorter, the better</h2>
        <p>Having observed the hiring process many times from both sides, I can share this: demonstrating how you think
          works best. It shows your ability to highlight the essential among the many. A short, concise resume always
          wins over a long, detailed one. In a world where time is the most valuable resource and attention is a rare
          luxury, long texts simply don’t survive.</p>
        <p>HR reviews dozens of resumes a day - and that’s not even their main job. Engineers look at resumes between
          meetings and production incidents. For them, interviews are a side task they often approach hastily and
          without full focus.</p>
        <p>It is what it is today. Information moves faster than ever. You have about 30 seconds to make someone think,
          “Alright, this candidate actually gets things done.”</p>
        <p>Show that you can focus on what truly matters. Stop writing memoirs. First, remove your school and university
          certificates - and that Acme Corp’s kicker trophy too. Then cut any experience older than 5-7 years. Keep only
          what helps show the trajectory and context of your career - your real background.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Building a character</h2>
        <p>Let’s view the interview as a quest in an online game. You need to clear a dungeon and earn some gold. You
          want to join a team, and the team is deciding whether you will bring real value.</p>
        <p>The first page of your resume is your character screen: it shows your strengths (skills), the tools you use
          (artifacts), and your achievements. This is what people will use to judge your potential contribution -
          definitely not the logs from your previous servers.</p>
        <p>Unlike in a game, you didn’t allocate your attributes in one evening - you’ve been doing it throughout your
          entire career. You developed skills, mastered tools, and reached new heights. And it’s on this first screen,
          before any question is ever asked, that the decision is made whether you’ll be invited to the “boss fight” -
          the next interview stage.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Skills and tools</h2>
        <p>This section often turns into a tag cloud. Candidates throw in every trendy keyword they can remember. In
          practice, you should highlight the technologies you actually use today. That helps the interviewer form a
          concrete picture of your profile.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you list Rust, C++ and Linux - you look like a systems engineer</li>
          <li>If you mention Terraform, Python and AWS - you likely lean toward infrastructure and automation</li>
          <li>If leadership and conflict resolution come first - you are moving into management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Arrange your skills in the right order. If you apply for different roles, adjust your resume for each one.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Highlight your contribution</h2>
        <p>Any business ultimately comes down to money. Your contribution is either revenue earned or costs saved for
          the company. A new feature that generated X in revenue - that’s a contribution. A new process that saved Y% of
          time - also a contribution. Every meaningful contribution should be measurable.</p>
        <p>“Implemented a framework” - questionable. “Improved team communication” - not convincing. It becomes
          convincing only when the result is visible and tangible.</p>
        <p>In the achievements section, focus on what you delivered, not how. What was the situation? What changed? And
          how did your actions drive that change?</p>
        <p>Here’s a link to the STAR method - a simple and useful technique for describing accomplishments: <a
            href="https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews/" target="_blank">STAR
            method</a></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Signals</h2>
        <p>The way a candidate describes achievements is itself a form of meta-information.</p>
        <blockquote>Senior Developer. Responsible for various tasks. Participated in CI/CD and microservices
          development. Good communication skills.</blockquote>
        <p>Anyone reading this has no idea what the person actually did.</p>
        <blockquote>Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines for Java microservices. Improved deployment speed by 40%.
          Collaborated with five teams to implement test automation.</blockquote>
        <p>Good! Now there are specifics. The person understands the process and the metrics. But it still lacks a sense
          of scale. It reads like a competent mid-level performer.</p>
        <blockquote>Led delivery of a trading automation platform used across multiple teams. Designed a Rust-based
          integration layer that reduced latency by 20%. Mentored four engineers and drove CI/CD adoption across
          departments.</blockquote>
        <p>Now you can see the context, the action, and the result clearly. Not “what they did,” but what they achieved,
          and at what level they’re used to operating. No doubt, this is a Senior+ engineer.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Header and footer</h2>
        <p>The header is simple: name, phone, Telegram, education, and sometimes the languages you speak and your work
          authorization. The “About me” or “Summary” section is easy to overthink, and fitting who you are into one or
          two sentences is not as simple as it seems.</p>
        <p>Everything after the achievements section is essentially the footer - a part most people will not even check
          (but automations can, see below). Give a brief overview of your previous companies. What matters most is when
          you started your career.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>HR tools compatibility</h2>
        <p>Nowadays many bots apply to every new position, so a recruiter receives hundreds of applications immediately.
          Automations based on tools like <a href="https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser"
            target="_blank">open-resume.com</a> are very common. And your resume will likely be parsed by automation,
          whether you like it or not. So the last advice is to check the compatibility of your resume with this parser.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The higher the seniority, the fewer words you need. A good resume is easy to read because its author thinks
          systematically. They no longer try to prove they can do a lot - they show they can identify what matters.</p>
        <p>While staying concise, remember that your resume must work for two audiences at the same time: the hiring
          team and the technical specialists. What you write must be useful to both.</p>
        <p>An interview doesn’t start with “tell me about yourself” - it starts the moment someone opens your file. A
          good resume is a real advantage.</p>
